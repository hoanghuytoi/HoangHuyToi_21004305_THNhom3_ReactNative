// Coding Challenge #1
// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new 
// gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so 
// one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. 
// Otherwise, no team wins!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
const calcAverage = (score1, score2, score3) => (score1 + score2 + score3) / 3;

// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
const avgDolphins = calcAverage(44, 23, 71);
const avgKoalas = calcAverage(65, 54, 49);

// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team 
// as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner 
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. 
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
const checkWinner = function (avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {
    if (avgDolphins >= 2 * avgKoalas) {
        console.log(`Dolphins win (${avgDolphins} vs. ${avgKoalas})`);
    } else if (avgKoalas >= 2 * avgDolphins) {
        console.log(`Koalas win (${avgKoalas} vs. ${avgDolphins})`);
    } else {
        console.log("No team wins!");
    }
}

// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2
checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas);

// 5. Ignore draws this time
const avgDolphins2 = calcAverage(85, 54, 41);
const avgKoalas2 = calcAverage(23, 34, 27);
checkWinner(avgDolphins2, avgKoalas2);
