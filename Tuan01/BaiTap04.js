// Coding Challenge #4

//Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is
//between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%
//1. Your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement
//Test data:
//ยง Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
//ยง To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
//ยง Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300

//2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: "The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value was 316.25"

function calculateTip(bill) {
    let tip = (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
    let total = bill + tip;
    console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip.toFixed(2)}, and the total value ${total.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
  
// Test data
calculateTip(275);
calculateTip(40);
calculateTip(430);
